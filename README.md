# 🧐 What's inside?
##In this repository I have the work of my very first project for a real world company, in this case: 
- Wildlife Response Services
## For this Project I have used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) -  React Framework
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Classes with modules
-  [Email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/) to connect the Contact Page 
- And much More
### That is right not the best structure for a project but I am happy with the knowledge I got working with it.
