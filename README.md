# üßê What's inside?
## In this repository I got to work with Wildlife Response Services to rebuilt their Website.
## Wildlife Response Services is a company that offers support to a huge variety of wildlife species when they are in need of special care when they have been affected by oil spills in their natural habitat. 

## For this Project I have used:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) -  React Framework
-  Flexbox
-  Grid
-  Boostrap Grid
-  CSS Classes with modules
-  [Email.js](https://www.emailjs.com/) to manage the data behind the Contact Page. 
- And much More
